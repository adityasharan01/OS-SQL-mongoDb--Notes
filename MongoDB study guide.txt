MongoDB
I have participated in InfyTQ exam for System Engineer. MongoDB is one such important topic From DBMS in that exam.
I am sharing few important queries from MongoDB.

MongoDB
- It is a unstructured database.
- It is a document database, which uses JSON like documents.
- It is a open-source software
Queries
To connect a database,
db=connect("localhost:27017/studDB")

here 27017 : host id
studDB : database name
After creating a database, we have to test whether we have connected to the database or not,
For that use: this will display current db name
db

In MongoDB, if we compare to sql,
Table                       ~ Collections
Rows                        ~ Documents
Attributes/Columns          ~ Fields
Basics commands:
CRUD - Create Read Update Delete

To show available databases :

show databases
show dbs

To show available COLLECTIONS in current database:
show collections

To create new collection:
db.createCollection('dummy')

dropping a database- it will drop the current database connected
db.dropDatabase()

Inserting a Document into the collection

1.db.dummy.insert({ fname:"ram", lname:'vijay' });
2.db.dummy.insertMany([{fname:"ramana",lname:'sai',age:25},{fname:'hanu',lname:'krissh'}]);
Printing the documents
db.dummy.find()

Note: when we print it we can find a field automaticaly added to each document , "_id" which is added by the MongoDB itself, to uniquely indentify each document.
To filter with field:
db.blog.find({fname:'ram'})

To print the document in human eye pleasing format we can use pretty():
db.blog.find().pretty();

to print sorted output based on particular column, we have to use sort() with the field name/(s) marked as true(1).
db.blog.find().sort({lname:1})

Updation:
To update the record we have to give to inputs,
1st the fields representing document which has to be updated. 2nd the new data. But this will completely delete the document and create a new document.So, we must pass all the fields for that document.

db.blog.update({fname:"abi"},{fname:"abishek"})
